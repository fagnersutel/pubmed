OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the vocal range of oral contraceptive (OC) users aged between 20 and 30 years.STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study.METHODS: Forty-eight women aged 20-30 years who used low-dose OCs and 24 age-matched women who did not use oral monophasic contraceptives (w/oOC) were enrolled. Acoustic analysis was performed using the Motor Speech Profile program, Model 4341 (Kay Elemetrics Corp). Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation.RESULTS: In the w/oOC group, the highest vocal tones in the sentence uttered using exclamatory intonation were similar in the follicular phases of two cycles (F1: 289<U+2009>±<U+2009>46<U+2009>Hz; F2: 284<U+2009>±<U+2009>61<U+2009>Hz). In the luteal phase of the first cycle, the vocal tones were lower, whereas in the second cycle they were higher than the tones in both follicular phases (L1: 274<U+2009>±<U+2009>42<U+2009>Hz; L2: 291<U+2009>±<U+2009>62<U+2009>Hz) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.056). In the highest vocal tones of the same sentence uttered using exclamatory intonation, the OC group showed lower tones (284<U+2009>±<U+2009>53<U+2009>Hz) than the w/oOC group (298<U+2009>±<U+2009>44<U+2009>Hz) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.048). In the lowest vocal tones of utterances of joy, the OC group showed higher values (180<U+2009>±<U+2009>39<U+2009>Hz) than the w/oOC group (169<U+2009>±<U+2009>44<U+2009>Hz) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.024). The close proximity of the highest to the lowest values of utterances of joy in the OC group (321<U+2009>±<U+2009>59<U+2009>Hz and 180<U+2009>±<U+2009>39<U+2009>Hz), when related to the w/oOC group (338<U+2009>±<U+2009>65<U+2009>Hz and 169<U+2009>±<U+2009>44<U+2009>Hz), suggests a reduced vocal modulation.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate that the use of low-dose OCs influences the vocal range of women during menacme.
